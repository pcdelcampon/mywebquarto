**ClusterCarac is an R package that helps you understand what makes each group in your data unique.** Whether your groups come from a clustering algorithm (k-means, hierarchical clustering…) or from predefined categories (customer segments, regions, age groups, user types), ClusterCarac reveals the key traits that distinguish one group from another.

### 🧠 **Turn raw data into clear, interpretable group profiles**

Instead of manually inspecting cross-tabs or reading long tables, ClusterCarac answers questions like:

> *“What characterizes Group A, B and C?”*\
> *“How do high-churn customers differ from low-churn ones?”*\
> *“What traits truly distinguish this segment?”*

### 🌍 **Useful in any field where groups appear in your data**

-   Customer and market segmentation

-   Social and demographic research

-   Public health and education projects

-   User and product analytics

-   Any dataset with categories or segments that need explanation

### 🧩 **In one sentence**

> **ClusterCarac turns groups into stories—showing what defines them, what sets them apart, and what truly matters.**

### ⭐ **Why I created ClusterCarac**

ClusterCarac exists because I wanted to bring back —in a modern, focused way— the spirit of the characterization algorithms originally implemented in [FactoClass](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FactoClass/index.html).

FactoClass, developed at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia with Professor [Campo Elías Pardo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/campo-el%C3%ADas-pardo-5ab19435/) and other collaborators, offered powerful tools for describing groups produced by clustering procedures. Over the years, many users repeatedly asked how to interpret or extract the characterization results from that package. These questions revealed something important:

> **People needed a clearer, more direct, and more accessible way to understand what defines each group in their data.**

ClusterCarac is my response to that need.

It is not a replacement for FactoClass, but rather a **retro-inspired return 🕹️👾⭐** to its core ideas — a simplified, refined, and more user-friendly tool dedicated entirely to group characterization.
